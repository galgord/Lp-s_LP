He’s the legend at LP, got that magic in his hands
Closed three-sixty-six deals, standin’ taller than the rest
Above the AE3 average by seventy-two percent
He’s in beast mode, baby, never breakin’ a sweat

They call him the $2 Million Dollar Man
He’s one of two to ever hit that mark again
But behind the numbers, there’s a heart that shines
‘Cause Father of the Year always makes the time

[Pre-Chorus]
He’s got that calm, cool spirit like the other side of the pillow
No matter the storm, he keeps it steady and mellow
His clients sing his praises, they feel his easy flow
Over twenty times on Good Vibes—yeah, the whole team knows

Ain’t no mountain he can’t move, watch him fly like he’s unstoppable
He’s bringin’ that good energy, makin’ sales feel like a miracle
Oh, Austin Groth, your hustle and your heart
Light up our world—every deal’s a work of art

[Verse 2]
When he talks ‘bout Georgia, his face starts to glow
That proud dad love is the sweetest thing we know
He’s jugglin’ fatherhood and crushin’ goals, day by day
Cool composure, drivin’ revenue in every way

So if you feelin’ that positivity, you might have caught his style
From the way he greets you, to that genuine smile
He’s a beacon of success, yeah, the numbers don’t lie
But it’s his warmth and soul that keep the vibe so high

He’s a Houston kid with a bulldog grin
Longtime friend of Andrew Stewart back when
Dad from Hawaii, that island vibe
But city hustle keeps his fire alive

Took his game to Outbound Engine’s floor
Number one rep for years, he always wanted more
Never stops hustlin’, never backs down
He’s got the spirit of a punk in this Texas town

[Pre-Chorus]
8 A.M. to 8 P.M. — that’s his creed
“Revenue generating hours,” nothing else he needs
People say, “You’ll burn out,” but he’s got one retort
“I’m just getting started,” no signs to abort

[Chorus]
He’s burnin’ bright like a Houston star
Takin’ on the world, yeah, he’s raisin’ the bar
Real estate deals, Airbnb on the coast
His old dog by his side, that’s what matters the most

He’ll call “Ryan Serhaunt” without missin’ a beat
Got Suzanne on speed dial, keepin’ it elite
Michael Faria’s story’s never understated
He’s livin’ life loud — watch him dominate it

[Verse 2]
He’s got a place on the coast, rakin’ in that cash
Talkin’ big about invests, never leavin’ it to chance
He’s a workaholic soldier, fueled by ambition
Punk rock mind with a fearless mission

Passion flares up like a neon sign

Born and raised on cheese and that Lambeau team.
He swears he’s Vin Diesel—just ask around,
In the office hallways, that joke’s renowned.

But behind those laughs, there’s a legend in play,
He’s chartin’ top-three hold rates every single day.
From the first inbound crew, he blazed the trail,
Pulled in two million TCV without fail.

He’s got a Midwest heart, but he’s livin’ down in Austin,
Cheerin’ every sale, no matter where it comes in.
When a deal gets closed, he’s right there raisin’ a toast,
To the Midwest wins—yeah, that’s what he loves the most.
He might be far from home, but he wears that badge with pride,
Zach’s a country soul, keepin’ green and gold alive.

He knows the hustle, he’s seen it all before,
From inbound calls to even leadin’ the score.
He’s an OG player, a pioneer of the game,
Still cheering on his teammates, never lookin’ for fame.

Every day’s a party when the pipeline flows,
He’ll ring that bell and let the whole floor know:
Your wins are his wins—he’s proud as can be,
Packin’ all that Midwest love for the world to see.

With that Vin Diesel grin and a heart so strong.
