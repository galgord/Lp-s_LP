He’s the legend at LP, got that magic in his hands
Closed three-sixty-six deals, standin’ taller than the rest
Above the AE3 average by seventy-two percent
He’s in beast mode, baby, never breakin’ a sweat

They call him the $2 Million Dollar Man
He’s one of two to ever hit that mark again
But behind the numbers, there’s a heart that shines
‘Cause Father of the Year always makes the time

[Pre-Chorus]
He’s got that calm, cool spirit like the other side of the pillow
No matter the storm, he keeps it steady and mellow
His clients sing his praises, they feel his easy flow
Over twenty times on Good Vibes—yeah, the whole team knows

[Chorus]
Ain’t no mountain he can’t move, watch him fly like he’s unstoppable
He’s bringin’ that good energy, makin’ sales feel like a miracle
Oh, Austin Groth, your hustle and your heart
Light up our world—every deal’s a work of art

[Verse 2]
When he talks ‘bout Georgia, his face starts to glow
That proud dad love is the sweetest thing we know
He’s jugglin’ fatherhood and crushin’ goals, day by day
Cool composure, drivin’ revenue in every way

So if you feelin’ that positivity, you might have caught his style
From the way he greets you, to that genuine smile
He’s a beacon of success, yeah, the numbers don’t lie
But it’s his warmth and soul that keep the vibe so high

[Bridge]
(Yeah) He’s always doin’ big things
(Oh) Feels like a dream the way he brings
His passion, hustle, fatherly love
Austin Groth — shining star above

[Chorus]
Ain’t no mountain he can’t move, watch him fly like he’s unstoppable
He’s bringin’ that good energy, makin’ sales feel like a miracle
Oh, Austin Groth, your hustle and your heart
Light up our world—every deal’s a work of art

[Outro]
Yes, you’re the legend at LP, forever holdin’ the crown
$2 Million strong, fatherly love, never let us down
So keep spreadin’ those good vibes, keep livin’ that dream
Austin Groth, you’re the realest, the top of our team.`

There’s someone we all know, movin’ fast and ridin’ high
A brand-new dog dad with a Bernedoodle by his side
Got a cyclin’ studio and a knack for launchin’ dreams
Always pushin’ boundaries, livin’ brighter than it seems

Oh, the energy is buzzin’, can’t keep it on the low
Mindful in the mornin’, set intentions just to grow
He’s his own competition, always raisin’ that bar
All that positivity—yeah, it’s gonna take him far

[Verse 2]
Brainstormin’ every minute, thinkin’ how to take that leap
Balancin’ life and work, never cuttin’ corners cheap
Sunshine on his face, and meditation in his heart
That unstoppable spirit, it’s been there from the start

Slack injection magic, fixin’ troubles far and wide
When a client’s in distress, he soothes them with grace
Turnin’ them into LP fans with a smile on his face
Though the cheese-rolling crown he’s yet to claim
He showed us all that hillside chaos, no one’s quite the same

[Bridge]
He’s the mentor of new hires, a guide when they call
In the Virtual Floor, he’s there for us all
Never waverin’ in kindness, always sharin’ what he knows

Keepin’ our culture strong each and every day

For the care and the growth he’s brought us here
One team, one groove—let the good times roll

He’s a Houston kid with a bulldog grin
Longtime friend of Andrew Stewart back when
Dad from Hawaii, that island vibe
But city hustle keeps his fire alive

Took his game to Outbound Engine’s floor
Number one rep for years, he always wanted more
Never stops hustlin’, never backs down
He’s got the spirit of a punk in this Texas town

[Pre-Chorus]
8 A.M. to 8 P.M. — that’s his creed
“Revenue generating hours,” nothing else he needs
People say, “You’ll burn out,” but he’s got one retort
“I’m just getting started,” no signs to abort

[Chorus]
He’s burnin’ bright like a Houston star
Takin’ on the world, yeah, he’s raisin’ the bar
Real estate deals, Airbnb on the coast
His old dog by his side, that’s what matters the most

He’ll call “Ryan Serhaunt” without missin’ a beat
Got Suzanne on speed dial, keepin’ it elite
Michael Faria’s story’s never understated
He’s livin’ life loud — watch him dominate it

[Verse 2]
He’s got a place on the coast, rakin’ in that cash
Talkin’ big about invests, never leavin’ it to chance
He’s a workaholic soldier, fueled by ambition
Punk rock mind with a fearless mission

Passion flares up like a neon sign
‘Cause for him, the hustle is a righteous kind
He’s forging his path, breakin’ every mold
Michael Faria on fire, watch his story unfold

All the critics scream, “Hey, slow down!”
But he’s revvin’ up with a hardcore sound
He’s the unstoppable force, from dawn ‘til night
Cause in punk rock and business, he’ll always fight

He’s burnin’ bright like a Houston star
Takin’ on the world, yeah, he’s raisin’ the bar
Real estate deals, Airbnb on the coast
His old dog by his side, that’s what matters the most

He’ll call “Ryan Serhaunt” without missin’ a beat
Got Suzanne on speed dial, keepin’ it elite
Michael Faria’s story’s never understated
He’s livin’ life loud — watch him dominate it

Yeah, he’s just getting started, can’t keep him down
Michael’s the name, he’s takin’ this town
From Houston roots to coastal dreams
A punk rock hustle, bustin’ at the seams!`

He’s a Wisconsin boy, a Green Bay dream,
Born and raised on cheese and that Lambeau team.
He swears he’s Vin Diesel—just ask around,
In the office hallways, that joke’s renowned.

[Pre-Chorus]
But behind those laughs, there’s a legend in play,
He’s chartin’ top-three hold rates every single day.
From the first inbound crew, he blazed the trail,
Pulled in two million TCV without fail.

[Chorus]
He’s got a Midwest heart, but he’s livin’ down in Austin,
Cheerin’ every sale, no matter where it comes in.
When a deal gets closed, he’s right there raisin’ a toast,
To the Midwest wins—yeah, that’s what he loves the most.
He might be far from home, but he wears that badge with pride,
Zach’s a country soul, keepin’ green and gold alive.

[Verse 2]
He knows the hustle, he’s seen it all before,
From inbound calls to even leadin’ the score.
He’s an OG player, a pioneer of the game,
Still cheering on his teammates, never lookin’ for fame.

[Bridge]
Every day’s a party when the pipeline flows,
He’ll ring that bell and let the whole floor know:
Your wins are his wins—he’s proud as can be,
Packin’ all that Midwest love for the world to see.

[Final Chorus]
He’s got a Midwest heart, but he’s livin’ down in Austin,
Cheerin’ every sale, no matter where it comes in.
When a deal gets closed, he’s right there raisin’ a toast,
To the Midwest wins—yeah, that’s what he loves the most.
He might be far from home, but he wears that badge with pride,
Zach’s a country soul, keepin’ green and gold alive.

[Outro]
Oh, Zach Brzezinski, keep on keepin’ on—
With that Vin Diesel grin and a heart so strong.
From Wisconsin to Austin, you’re still Packin’ pride,
Celebrate those deals—‘cause this country boy’s ride or die!`

Craftin’ stained glass dreams in her creative room
Got those disco witch vibes, sparkle in her eyes
Lightin’ up the night, she’s a magic surprise

Earrings gleam like streetlights in the dark
Words she writes cast a lunar spark
She’s howlin’ at the moon, showin’ all her heart
An amazing dog mom, lovin’ from the start

Travelin’ the world, breakin’ normal rules
Spellbound by her fire, she lights up every stage

Born to roam the skies with a passport in her hand
She’s conjurin’ wild adventures in every land
From neon clubs to ancient cobblestone streets
Her creativity roars, and the crowd can’t compete

Carvin’ her own path, magic in her flow
Strummin’ power chords under shimmering lights

Living life in motion, never stuck in time

She stepped up to lead in a shifting tide
Helped plan the next big thing, kept the vision alive
With a careful eye for detail on every code review
She’s watchin’ for tech debt that we never outgrew

But her anchor’s in her craft, makin’ sure it’s strong

She’s part of CIQE, keepin’ us on track
Improvin’ every line of code, no time to slack
Content migrations, website-level search
Major TypeScript moves—it’s all in her research

But when it’s time to build, her steady hand brings ease
With thorough dedication and a soul that’s never still

Nomad on the horizon, wander where you will
We know your mark remains, coding magic still
Thu Trinh, your spirit breathes new life in every place
We’ll follow in your footsteps, inspired by your grace.`
