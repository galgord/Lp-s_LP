    'Good Vibes Only': `[Verse 1]
He's the legend at LP, got that magic in his hands
Closed three-sixty-six deals, standin' taller than the rest
Above the AE3 average by seventy-two percent
He's in beast mode, baby, never breakin' a sweat

They call him the $2 Million Dollar Man
He's one of two to ever hit that mark again
But behind the numbers, there's a heart that shines
'Cause Father of the Year always makes the time

[Pre-Chorus]
He's got that calm, cool spirit like the other side of the pillow
No matter the storm, he keeps it steady and mellow
His clients sing his praises, they feel his easy flow
Over twenty times on Good Vibes—yeah, the whole team knows

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain he can't move, watch him fly like he's unstoppable
He's bringin' that good energy, makin' sales feel like a miracle
Oh, Austin Groth, your hustle and your heart
Light up our world—every deal's a work of art

[Verse 2]
When he talks 'bout Georgia, his face starts to glow
That proud dad love is the sweetest thing we know
He's jugglin' fatherhood and crushin' goals, day by day
Cool composure, drivin' revenue in every way

So if you feelin' that positivity, you might have caught his style
From the way he greets you, to that genuine smile
He's a beacon of success, yeah, the numbers don't lie
But it's his warmth and soul that keep the vibe so high

[Bridge]
(Yeah) He's always doin' big things
(Oh) Feels like a dream the way he brings
His passion, hustle, fatherly love
Austin Groth — shining star above

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain he can't move, watch him fly like he's unstoppable
He's bringin' that good energy, makin' sales feel like a miracle
Oh, Austin Groth, your hustle and your heart
Light up our world—every deal's a work of art

[Outro]
Yes, you're the legend at LP, forever holdin' the crown
$2 Million strong, fatherly love, never let us down
So keep spreadin' those good vibes, keep livin' that dream
Austin Groth, you're the realest, the top of our team.`,

    'The launch life': `[Verse 1]
There's someone we all know, movin' fast and ridin' high
A brand-new dog dad with a Bernedoodle by his side
Got a cyclin' studio and a knack for launchin' dreams
Always pushin' boundaries, livin' brighter than it seems

[Chorus]
Oh, the energy is buzzin', can't keep it on the low
Mindful in the mornin', set intentions just to grow
He's his own competition, always raisin' that bar
All that positivity—yeah, it's gonna take him far

[Verse 2]
Brainstormin' every minute, thinkin' how to take that leap
Balancin' life and work, never cuttin' corners cheap
Sunshine on his face, and meditation in his heart
That unstoppable spirit, it's been there from the start

[Chorus (reprise)]
Oh, the energy is buzzin', can't keep it on the low
Mindful in the mornin', set intentions just to grow
He's his own competition, always raisin' that bar
All that positivity—yeah, it's gonna take him far

[Outro]
We're followin' his story, watchin' greatness on the run
Baskin' in his good vibes, countin' victories by the ton
Got Blitzen in the back seat, a big ol' wagging tail
Welcome to this sitcom—where good times never fail!`,
